For frontend, I want a login/register page for patients, a login page for admins in a separate domain. After a patient registers, the page should redirect to login. Upon successful login, the patient must be redirected to a home page with a nav on top "Home" "Book Appointment", "View Upcoming Appointments", "Search Clinic Areas", "Profile" "Logout". When patient clicks book appointment, the patient gets redirected to a page with a search page for searching the clinic, which will display a bunch of clinics depending on the search term. The patient will then click on a clinic and the clinic details and its feedbacks must be present, along with a "Book appointment" button. When patient clicks the book appointment button, the patient is redirected to a form which fills out details such as ailments, slot selection, doctor selection, etc. and submits. Upon submitting this form, the patient is redirected to a payments page where they will make the necessary payments. Upon successful payment, the patient is alerted of a successful appointment booking and is redirected to the View Upcoming Appointments page. In the view appointments page, there will be a list of appointments with a view button and a cancel button. When patient cancels an appointment, a confirmation dialogue is shown whether the patient is sure to cancel the appointment. When the patient clicks yes, the appointment is removed and an amount refund acknowledgement is shown. In the search clinic areas a search bar is shown at the top, along with a bunch of clinics. The patient can use the search bar for searching the clinic and clinics are shown in the page. The patient can click a clinic to view its details and book appointments from there too. When patient clicks "Profile" in the nav, the patient is redirected to a profile page where their details are shown, along with a link to see their medical records, receipts, and a feedback column, a reset password button, and a delete account button. When patient presses logout button, the patient is logged out.

Now for the admin portal, the admin can login. Upon logging in, the admin is redirected to a home page. In the nav bar, there will be a Patients, Clinic Areas, Appointments, Payments, Profile, And logout. Patients will have a dropdown with "View Patient Profile", "Update Patient Details", "Delete Patient", "View Patient Feedbacks". Clinic Areas will have a dropdown with options "Create Clinic", "Delete Clinic", "Search Clinic", "Add Slots", "View Appointments". Appointments will have a dropdown with options "Add Appointments", "Update Appointments", "Remove Appointments", "Search Appointments", "Add Medical Record". Payments will contain a dropdown with options "View Payments", "Refund Payments", etc. Profile will have details of the admin, a reset password button and a delete account button. A super admin will have an additional nav called Admins, which will have a dropdown "Add admin", "Delete Admin", "Search Admin". Logout will logout the admin.
